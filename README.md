# Signal-Processing-Project
In this project we have added high frequency noise to a input signal and applied
wavelet transform to obtain the high frequency and low frequency
components. We have forced the high frequency components to become zero
and applied inverse wavelet transform to obtain the denoised signal.

Wavelet transform-based denoising offers an efficient and flexible approach
for noise reduction in signals, balancing noise suppression with the
preservation of essential signal features. Its ability to capture localized details
and adapt to the signal's frequency content makes it a valuable tool for a wide
range of applications, including audio processing, image denoising, and
biomedical signal analysis.
